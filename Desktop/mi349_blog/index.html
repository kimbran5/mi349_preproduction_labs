            <p>Electric skateboarding is an extremely fun and relatively inexpensive hobby. To get started, all you need is an electric skateboard, a helmet, and decently grippy shoes. 
                A solid sense of balance also helps a lot too. The hobby itself is risky, but the thrill and freedom of a self-propelled skateboard is highly addictive.</p>
            <p>I watched famous YouTuber Casey Neistat ride Boosted Boards for years but couldn't afford to spend an upwards of $2000 to buy one. 
                Over the years, electric skateboards became more affordable, and I finally bought my own. I purchased a Tynee Mini 2 for less than $700 - a fraction of the cost for a Boosted Board. I have been riding it around MSU campus for weeks and am super happy with it. 
                It has a maximum range of 25 miles, and a top speed of nearly 30 miles per hour. Riding at those speeds is too scary for me. When going fast, people tend to develop "speed wobbles" due to instability of the skateboard "trucks." I'll try to reach those speeds one day, but for now I'm content cruising to classes or to pickup groceries. 
                Since it's getting cold and approaching winter in Michigan, I'll have to find another hobby to keep me busy until springtime.</p>

            <p>I have been learning to cook lately, but it's been difficult. No matter how hard I try, my cooking is nowhere near as good as my Mom's. 
                I have resorted to ordering Domino's pizza the past few weeks, but I recently tried one of those prepared "food boxes" that I see sitting in my apartment lobby.</p>
            <p>Using a free coupon, I ordered a food box from Hello Fresh, and it arrived within 2 days. I selected recipes such as Peruvian rice and chicken, bulgogi pork tenderloin, and griddled onion cheeseburgers. 
                I have only cooked a few recipes so far, but the bulgogi pork tenderloin has been my favorite so far. The sauce was sweet, and the inclusion of lemon zest and sesame seeds added new dimensions of flavor to my cooking.</p>
            <p>Although these food boxes are expensive, I think they helped me become a better home cook. I'm hesitant to call myself a "cook" or "chef" because my skills are equivalent to those of Chef Boyardee. It was definitely fun for me to experiment and add new elements to my food. 
                Using extra ingredients from the packages, I added spices and flavors to meals I cook on a daily basis. I think cooking is really fun, but I hate washing the mountain of dishes afterwards.</p>
